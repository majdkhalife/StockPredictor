## Welcome to My Stock Predictor GitHub Page!
Here, I’m experimenting with various models to predict stock prices and sharing my implementations along with what I've learnt from the process. If you're interested in exploring how data can be used to model the stock market, this repository is a great place to start.

As a student, I’ll update this repo as time permits, and I appreciate any feedback or contributions!
