I) Introduction:
Predicting stock prices is an impossible task. So if you came to this repository hoping to become the next Warren Buffet because of your ML skills, then sorry to say that won't work. Predicting stocks correctly implies that you have a deep understanding on human psychology, which is simply impossible, as humans are emotional creatures who are impossible to predict.
However, we can use a machine learning approach to forecast future prices by training a model on historical data and projecting ahead.

II) How will we be estimating future stock prices?
We will be using a method called time series forecasting. This technique predicts future events by analyzing trends of the past, holding the assunmption that future trends will be similar to historic ones.
Key Concepts:
  Lagged Features: Using past values  of a variable as features.
  Windowing: Creating sequences of observations to predict future values.
  Trend and Seasonality: Accounting for long-term trends and repeating patterns.
